      <h2 class="subtitle-large">Christ, Our Cornerstone</h2>
      <p class="subtitle-large-content">
        Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit. <br><strong>EPHESIANS 2:19-22 NKJV</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">History of Our Church</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1990s, a few friends and students began a weekly Bible study fellowship in Philadelphia to study the Word of God & pray together. Over the years, the fellowship moved places & the Lord added new people and built up that group of believers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cornerstone Fellowship was officially formed in 2005 & continued to have fellowship and Bible studies on Fridays. In 2008, the church began with weekly Sunday worship services and the Lord has established this church for His glory!
      </p>
      <p>
        Cornerstone is a non-denominational, Bible-believing Church living to glorify the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!
      </p>
